China’s Bank Stocks: High Dividends in a Fragile Economy

Discover why China’s bank stocks became market darlings in 2024. High dividends and stability drove record gains despite economic challenges. Insights for 2025.
China’s Bank Stocks: A Bull Run Amid Economic Concerns
Mainland Investors Rush for High-Yield Bank Shares

China’s banking sector emerged as the top performer in the stock market last year, drawing investors with its high dividends and relative stability. Despite a sluggish economy and financial challenges, these stocks offered compelling returns that surpassed government bonds, making them a favourite among institutional investors seeking safe, income-generating assets.
A Year of Stellar Gains

In 2024, the banking sector outshined all 31 industries in the Shenwan industry classification system with a 34.4% surge in value. Leading this charge were regional players such as Bank of Shanghai, which saw a remarkable 69% increase, and Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank, among others, with gains exceeding 60%. Even the “Big Six” state-owned commercial lenders hit record highs, defying their reputation as low-growth and unappealing investments.

However, this stellar performance came despite muted profit growth. Over the first nine months of 2024, combined revenues of the 42 listed banks fell slightly, while net profits rose by just 1.43%. Declining net interest margins (NIMs) and tepid loan growth added to the sector’s challenges. Nevertheless, investors prioritised stability and yield over fundamentals.
Dividends Drive Demand

With yields on Chinese government bonds dropping below 1.7%, dividend yields from bank stocks, averaging 6% in 2023, became a key attraction. Some banks, such as China Minsheng Banking Corp, offered yields above 8%. The government’s push for higher and more frequent dividends further boosted investor confidence, solidifying banks as a low-risk, high-yield asset class.
Cognitive Biases in Investment Decisions

Investors overlooked fundamental weaknesses, such as rising non-performing loans and falling NIMs, in favour of immediate returns. This behaviour reflects confirmation bias — the tendency to focus on favourable indicators like dividends while ignoring risk factors. It also highlights recency bias, with investors prioritising recent strong performance over long-term considerations.
Challenges Ahead for 2025

The question remains whether the rally can persist. Analysts point to multiple risks, including potential economic recovery that may shift investor preferences, rising interest rates, and exposure to systemic risks. The government’s macroeconomic policies will also play a pivotal role. While fiscal expansion and loose monetary policies might support high-yield assets, shifts in credit risks and lending dynamics could pose challenges.
Weak Borrowing Demand Persists

Despite rate cuts, businesses and consumers remain cautious about borrowing, exacerbating pressure on banks. Narrowing NIMs, now below the critical 1.8% threshold, further strain profitability. Emerging risks in retail and consumer sectors add to concerns, while hidden vulnerabilities in the banking system keep price-to-book ratios historically low at an average of 0.61.
Investor Sentiments at a Crossroads

The current bull run underscores a broader trend of income-focused investing in a low-rate environment. Yet, as systemic risks and economic uncertainties loom, investors must balance short-term gains with long-term resilience. The fate of bank stocks in 2025 will likely hinge on a delicate interplay of fiscal policies, market dynamics, and investor psychology.
