Singapore’s SME Face Fierce Competition and Rising Costs

Singapore SMEs face rising costs and global competition. ASME calls for unity and innovation to tackle challenges and seize opportunities overseas.
Red Ocean Reality: Challenges Facing Singapore’s SME
Intense Competition and Rising Costs Threaten Local Businesses

Singapore’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are grappling with intense competition, described as a “red ocean” by Mr Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME). The local market is becoming increasingly saturated as foreign players, especially Chinese investors equipped with advanced technology and integrated supply chains, establish themselves in Singapore.

Rising business costs, from labour to rent, compound the challenges. According to Mr Ang, landlords remain firm on rents, while employees seek better compensation, leaving SMEs with limited options. These pressures are forcing many local businesses to rethink their strategies and explore global opportunities to ensure survival.
Global Expansion: A Necessary Strategy

ASME has urged SMEs to expand beyond Singapore’s borders. With initiatives to facilitate overseas ventures, including aggregation projects and collaborative bids, the association aims to give smaller businesses access to larger markets. Mr Ang shared examples such as partnering on bulk orders from China or bidding for projects in the Middle East. These efforts highlight the importance of collaboration over competition among SMEs to capture global market share.
Cognitive Biases and Missed Opportunities

The current crisis underscores cognitive biases in local businesses. Many SME owners, influenced by a survival mentality, prioritise short-term gains over long-term growth. The inclination to monetise rather than invest in scalability and innovation limits their potential to achieve global success. Additionally, some SMEs rely heavily on government grants without leveraging these resources to build sustainable business models.
The Role of Technology and Innovation

To thrive, SMEs must embrace innovation, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital tools. However, Mr Ang cautioned that mere cost subsidies for technologies like Microsoft Copilot are insufficient. True competitiveness lies in developing customised workflows and enhancing productivity beyond standard tools.

ASME is advocating for increased funding to support innovation and streamline grant processes. This includes proposals such as upfront wage payments for temporary staff and flexible software subscription credits to ease financial strain on SMEs.
Addressing Advocacy Challenges

With over 300,000 SMEs accounting for 70 per cent of employment and half of Singapore’s economic output, effective advocacy is crucial. Mr Ang criticised sweeping generalisations in SME advocacy, calling for a more granular approach to address specific industry issues. He emphasised ASME’s commitment to championing the interests of smaller enterprises, especially those with annual revenues under $10 million.
A Call for Unity and Collaboration

Ultimately, Mr Ang believes that SMEs must unite to overcome challenges. By demonstrating their competence in the global market, they can eventually collaborate with multinational corporations on equal footing. As the 2025 Budget looms, ASME’s wish list reflects this vision, advocating for policies that prioritise innovation, digitalisation, and internationalisation.

With the right strategies and collective action, Singapore’s SMEs can transform the challenges of a “red ocean” into opportunities for growth and resilience.
